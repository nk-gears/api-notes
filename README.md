# api-notes


API's has become the fundamental building blocks for connecting various business products and services. Businesses are no more restricted to a software vendor lockin. If a specific feature is missing in the traditional system they can always plugin an external service using the API and integrate them.

I have integrated 100's of external API's and based on my experience i would like to jot down my experience  on these API's. There are some API's which i really enjoyed due to their great documentation and simplicity of the endpoint objects. 

Reading the entire API Documentation of Third Party API's is practically time consuming. This repository contains notes for developers or API integration specialist to be aware of the challenges those API's going to have and how we can solve them in the right way.

Here the Initial List. Please send a PR to include any other API's.

Please see the CONTRIBUTION Guide for a Basic Generic Template
